TeeTime is a project I made as part of the CIMSO Hospitality Hackathon 2025, which was placed in the final round. 
It is a golf course booking application, made with flutter which uses Google maps SDK, Firebase realtime database and Firestore.

The application has all the basic functionalities such as login, signup, realtime booking and notification.

#The Special feature this application provides is the ability to make your bookings public, sort of like an invitation, which other golf players can see and join. 

There are profile edit functionalities, golf course bookings, etc..
